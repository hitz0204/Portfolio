        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>      
        <p>
        My name is Moritz König (Koenig), and I am a creative with a strong interest in the intersection of humans and technology. I work across UX/UI design, web design, creative coding, 3D design, and type design, with a focus on creating clear, thoughtful digital experiences that support and enhance user interaction.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout my studies, curiosity and a willingness to learn have been key drivers of my development. I actively explore new tools, disciplines, and workflows, allowing me to approach problems from different perspectives and adapt quickly to new challenges. I am particularly interested in combining methods from multiple fields to develop solutions that are both functional and conceptually strong.
        <br>
        <br>
        My working process is structured yet exploratory. I enjoy analyzing problems, experimenting with different approaches, and refining ideas through iteration. Working across design and code has helped me build a flexible mindset and a strong appreciation for collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently seeking an internship where I can apply my existing skills, expand my practical experience, and contribute to a team. I am motivated, reliable, and eager to learn, and I value environments that encourage open exchange, curiosity, and thoughtful design.

            Over the course of decades, the poster shaped the way information was communicated in public spaces. In an increasingly commercialized and digital world, the poster now faces new challenges. This experimental work explores the design of code-based and distance-responsive animated posters in order to illustrate a possible future for poster design.

        <h3>CHRISTOPH RUMPF REDESIGN</h3>
        <div class="description">
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            Between youth culture and high fashion lies the redesign of the namesake brand by Austrian designer Christoph Rumpf. The goal of the redesign was to close the visual and functional gap between the Instagram page and the shop. Through detailed analysis of personas, user journeys, and user stories, a usage concept was developed that prioritizes the needs of customers and communicates a clear brand identity.

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            Where limitations are purposefully set, space is created for ideas to flourish. Boundaries can compel you to work and think in new ways, opening a domain for growth shaped by the very constraints you choose. By restricting myself to creating with nothing more than a simple grid as a foundation, through trial, error, and repetition, I discovered a way of exploring design and especially motion that I would never have imagined otherwise.

          <p>
            Inspired by flowing water that gradually shapes its surroundings through continuous erosion, as well as by the childhood experience of tracing raindrops on a windowpane, Pluvia seeks to capture and make visible processes of transformation. Through its variable nature, Pluvia embodies the essence of transformation itself, revealing how subtle, persistent movement can reshape form and perception over time.
